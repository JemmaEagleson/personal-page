    <p class="Intro"><strong>I'm an IxD student studying in Belfast with a love of simplicity, good design and music. I believe digital technology should be a pleasure to use as well as a beautiful piece of artwork to look at.</p>

    <h3 id="About-Me">STUFF ABOUT ME</h3>
 
    <p>I'm currently in my 1st year of ixD at Belfast Art College. I live in Belfast and love keeping up to date with the local art scene and checking out as many exhibitions as I can!    </p>
    <p class="AMP">I love to inject creative cool into all my projects and allow my ideas to come alive both on screen and on paper. I take inspiration from the people and objects around me as well as my favourite artists and designers.</p>
